Bitcoin Mining Signature Image Generator

This is the code for what used to be hosted on [btcstats.net](http://btcstats.net).

It is licensed with the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) if you'd like to take it and do something with it.

This is an ASP.NET MVC application (albeit a very simple/small one).  To host it as-is, you'll need:

* A Windows server with IIS 7 or higher and .NET 4.0 or higher to host the website itself
* A SQL Server to host the database that the website uses
